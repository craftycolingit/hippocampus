// The Go tests beside this directory scan app.js as text, which holds the KEY space - every key a
// check reads is a declared field - but cannot say what a check concludes. That needs the script
// run, and it can be: everything at the top level is a declaration, and the one statement that
// touches the DOM is the trailing init() call, which is cut off here. What remains needs no
// document at all until something renders, and nothing here renders.
//
// localStorage is deliberately absent. persist() and restore() wrap every access in try/catch for
// a browser with storage disabled, and the ReferenceError lands there, so the wizard behaves exactly
// as it does in a private window.
