// mint a JWT access token rather than an opaque one.

// without `unsafe-inline` blocks an onclick= attribute and a style= attribute outright, and blocks
// them SILENTLY - a CSP violation is a console warning, not an exception - so a page with either
// would half-work in a way no test would notice. That is why the drift guard in webuitest asserts
// neither exists, and why this and that assertion have to move together.
