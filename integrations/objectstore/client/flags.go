// RegisterCommonFlags defines the flags both binaries share: how to reach the Hippocampus service,
// how to reach the bucket, and the logging and observability wiring. Each command adds its own on
// top.
//
// Only flag definitions live here - each command's main.go owns the viper binding and the reads,
// per the repo convention - and the flag names match the Config fields so a main reads them back
// with the same string.
//
// defaultHealthPort differs by binary rather than by preference: the gateway and the reaper are
// routinely run on one host, and two processes defaulting to the same probe port means one of them
// fails to start for a reason that has nothing to do with its job.
