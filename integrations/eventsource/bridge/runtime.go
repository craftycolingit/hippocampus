// already handled elsewhere. A broker unreachable at startup exits the process before the consume
// loop begins - the supervisor's problem, and visible as a restart - while a mid-run disconnect is
// the adapters' own to retry on their own schedule. What nothing else would notice is the
// Hippocampus end going away, since a bridge with no traffic and a bridge that cannot write look
// identical from outside. That is the gap this closes.
