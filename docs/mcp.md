# MCP server

`integrations/mcp` is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that
gives an LLM host — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, or any other MCP client — tools for storing and
recalling memories in a running Hippocampus instance.

It is a thin **bridge**: every tool call is turned into a gRPC request against the Hippocampus
service named by `--address`. The bridge holds no state of its own, so the host can spawn, kill,
and restart it freely. Because it is a normal gRPC client, it works against any deployment topology
— an embedded per-tenant SQLite instance, a centralised Postgres/MySQL store, or a read/write
replica behind a load balancer.

## Install

On macOS or Linux, install it from the tap:

```sh
brew install fastbean-au/tap/hippocampus-mcp
```

Otherwise grab a pre-built binary for your platform from the
[releases page](https://github.com/fastbean-au/hippocampus/releases) — each release attaches
`hippocampus-mcp` archives for Linux, macOS, and Windows on amd64/arm64, with a `checksums.txt` to
verify them. This is the easiest path for the local stdio use case: no Go toolchain required.

Or build from source (the bridge is its own Go module, so build it with `-C` — the binary lands in
the current directory):

```sh
go build -C integrations/mcp -o "$PWD/hippocampus-mcp" .
```

Or, for the HTTP transport, pull the image (see [Running with Docker](#running-with-docker)):

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/fastbean-au/hippocampus-mcp:latest
```

## Tools

The surface is the per-item memory-and-event operations a model needs to give, retrieve, revise, and
forget memories. The administrative, destructive, and bulk data-movement RPCs (`Purge`, `Sleep`,
`Export`/`Import`/`Transfer`/`Clear`, `DeleteMemoriesByFilter`/`DeleteEventsByFilter`, event
deletion/merge, and `SummariseMemories` — which deletes
an event's memories, replacing them with an LLM-generated summary) are **not** exposed, so a model
cannot wipe or exfiltrate a store through this bridge. The mutating tools (`store_memory`,
`update_memory`, `delete_memories`, `link_memories`, `unlink_memories`, `create_event`,
`update_event`, `end_event`, `link_events`, `unlink_events`) are all `writer`-tier; what a given
token may actually do is
enforced by the service's [role tiers](configuration.md#authorisation), so a `reader`-scoped token is
refused every mutation regardless of which tools are registered here. `delete_memories` is a by-id
scalpel — it can only remove memories the caller explicitly names — not the bulk `Purge`/`Clear` or
the predicate deletions, which stay `admin`-tier and off this surface. That is the same line the
introspection tools are drawn on: a model may act on records it can name, never on a set it can only
describe.

**The four introspection tools are `reader`, and none of them enumerates.** `whoami` describes the
connection; `consolidation_status` names no record at all; `significance_levels` reports the scale
rather than anything ranked on it; and `explain_consolidation` answers only about ids the caller
supplies and could already read in full through `list_memories`. Between them they let a model ask
the question this store exists to answer — *is this memory about to go, and how long has it got?* —
which none of the others can. `PreviewConsolidation` is the one that does enumerate, and it stays
`admin` and off this surface.

**Call `whoami` first.** `search_memories` offers `semantic` and `hybrid`, and whether a deployment
can serve either depends on its storage driver and on whether OpenSearch and an embedding model are
configured. `whoami` reports the modes that work here, using the same names the `mode` input takes,
so a model can adapt rather than discover an unavailable mode by having a search rejected. It also
reports `consolidation_enabled`, which is `false` on a replica — where nothing is forgetting and the
decay tools have no schedule to report.

**Bound the model's reach as well as its verbs.** The tier decides what a model may do; a
[group scope](configuration.md#group-scoping) decides which records it may do it to. Giving the
bridge a token scoped to one group is the natural way to attach a model to one project or workspace
in a shared store: every tool above narrows to it, out-of-scope memories report `NotFound` rather
than confirming they exist, and the model's own writes are stamped with that group automatically —
so it need not (and cannot) choose where its memories are filed. Note this is a soft partition; see
[the trust boundary](security.md#group-scoping-and-the-trust-boundary).

| `store_memory`                 | `StoreMemory`                | Store text with a significance, optionally with `metadata` key/value labels; low-significance memories are forgotten over time.                                                                                                              |
| `update_memory`                | `UpdateMemory`               | Revise a memory by id; only fields you set change, significance `0` leaves it unchanged. `metadata` **replaces** the stored labels wholesale; `clear_metadata`/`clear_group` remove them, since an omitted field means "leave unchanged".    |
| `delete_memories`              | `DeleteMemories`             | Forget memories by id on demand (unknown ids ignored); a scalpel, not a bulk wipe.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `recall_memories`              | `RecallMemories`             | Fetch by id **and reinforce** — resets the decay clock, raises effective significance.                                                                                                                                                       |
| `search_memories`              | `SearchMemories`             | Content search, built in on every driver. `mode` selects keyword (default), semantic or hybrid (those two need an embedding model and OpenSearch); `offset` pages and `stored_after`/`stored_before` bound it. `reinforce` off by default.   |
| `link_memories`                | `LinkMemories`               | Associate one memory with others, each link carrying a significance. Both ends must already exist; re-linking a pair re-weights it.                                                                                                          |
| `unlink_memories`              | `UnlinkMemories`             | Remove links between one memory and the memories named, in either direction. Unknown targets are ignored.                                                                                                                                    |
| `get_memory_links`             | `GetMemoryLinks`             | List what a memory is linked to and its total link significance; `direction` narrows to outbound or inbound. Read-only.                                                                                                                      |
| `list_memories`                | `GetMemories`                | Read-only browse by group, significance, `metadata` labels, or `ids` for particular memories; `recalled: false` finds memories never recalled; `order_by`/`order_dir` sort the page. Does **not** reinforce.                                 |
| `create_event`                 | `StoreEvent`                 | A named time span memories can be grouped under; takes `metadata` labels like a memory.                                                                                                                                                      |
| `update_event`                 | `UpdateEvent`                | Revise an event by id; only fields you set change. `metadata` **replaces** the stored labels wholesale, and `clear_metadata`/`clear_group` remove them — the same semantics `update_memory` has, for the same reason.                        |
| `end_event`                    | `EndEvent`                   | Close an event, defaulting to now. An event never ended stores an end time of 0, which sorts it as the oldest-ended rather than the most recent; its memories are untouched.                                                                  |
| `get_event`                    | `GetEventById`               | Fetch one event — what the `event_id` on a memory actually refers to. Returns its memory count, optionally its links, and never its memories: page those with `list_memories`.                                                               |
| `list_events`                  | `GetEvents`                  | Read-only browse of events, filterable by `metadata` labels, `name_contains`, `description_contains`, `ended` and `linked_to`, and sortable via `order_by`/`order_dir`.                                                                      |
| `link_events`                  | `LinkEvents`                 | Associate one event with others. An event's links raise the effective significance of every memory under it, so this is the coarser of the two levers over what survives.                                                                    |
| `unlink_events`                | `UnlinkEvents`               | Remove links between one event and the events named, in either direction. Unknown targets are ignored.                                                                                                                                       |
| `get_event_links`              | `GetEventLinks`              | List what an event is linked to and its total link significance; `direction` narrows to outbound or inbound. Read-only.                                                                                                                      |
| `get_summarisation_candidates` | `GetSummarisationCandidates` | Events the last consolidation cycle flagged as worth condensing.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `significance_levels`          | `GetSignificanceLevels`      | The significance values this store actually uses, ascending — read it before choosing one, so a new item is ranked against the existing scale rather than an invented number.                                                                |
| `explain_consolidation`        | `ExplainConsolidation`       | Where the memories you name stand: value against threshold, days since the decay clock reset, whether a cycle now would forget them, and days left. This is how a model learns a memory is about to go, in time to recall it.                |
| `consolidation_status`         | `GetConsolidationStatus`     | Whether this instance forgets at all, when the next cycle is due, and what the last one removed. Names no record; reports `consolidation_enabled: false` on a replica.                                                                       |
| `whoami`                       | `WhoAmI`                     | What this connection can do: role, group scope, service version, and which `search_memories` modes the deployment serves. Call it before using semantic or hybrid search rather than discovering an unavailable mode by being rejected.       |

Memories and events are returned as plain JSON objects (the read-only fields — `id`, `time_stamp`,
`recall_count`, `is_summary`, and so on — included) so the model can reason about them and feed ids
back into `recall_memories`.

## Transports

- **stdio** (default) — the host launches this binary as a subprocess and speaks MCP over its
  stdin/stdout. All logging goes to **stderr**; stdout carries only the MCP protocol stream.
- **streamable HTTP** (`--transport http`) — serves the same tools over HTTP for a remote/hosted
  host instead. It listens on `127.0.0.1:8090` by default.

### Securing the HTTP transport

Whoever reaches the HTTP listener acts with the bridge's own `--token`, and a useful bridge's token
is a writer's, which includes `delete_memories`. Two settings guard it:

- `--http-token` (or `HIPPOCAMPUS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN`) makes every request present
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, compared in constant time; anything else is answered `401`.
- With no `--http-token`, the bridge **refuses** to listen on anything but a loopback address
  (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, `localhost`). `:8090`, `0.0.0.0` or a hostname is refused at startup unless
  `--allow-unauthenticated-http` says the exposure is deliberate (a private network that is itself
  the boundary), and even then a warning is logged.

```sh
hippocampus-mcp --address memory.internal:50051 --token "$HIPPO_TOKEN" \
  --transport http --http-address :8090 --http-token "$MCP_HTTP_TOKEN"
```

The inbound token is a shared secret, not a scheme with roles or expiry. Rotating it means a restart,
and it carries no TLS: terminate TLS in front of the bridge before it leaves a trusted network.

### Health endpoints

The HTTP transport serves the same lifecycle endpoints as every other component, on the same
listener and ahead of `--http-token`, since an orchestrator's probe carries no credentials. They
disclose only the build and whether the service behind the bridge is reachable.

| Endpoint | Answers | Fails when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/livez` | is this process alive (the liveness and startup probe) | never, while the process runs |
| `/readyz` | can it do its job right now | the Hippocampus service is unreachable or not serving, or shutdown has begun |
| `/healthz` | the same as `/livez`, under its older name | never, while the process runs |

Over stdio there is no listener and nothing to probe: the MCP host owns the process.

## Connecting to the service

```sh
# plaintext, no auth (a locally-running service)
hippocampus-mcp --address localhost:50051

# with a bearer token (the service has auth.method hmac/idp)
hippocampus-mcp --address memory.internal:50051 --token "$HIPPO_TOKEN"

# over TLS, verifying against a private CA
hippocampus-mcp --address memory.internal:50051 --tls --tls-ca-cert /etc/ssl/hippo-ca.pem
```

The auth and TLS options mirror the service's own [authentication](configuration.md#authentication)
and [TLS](configuration.md#tls) surface. Mint a token with
`hippocampus --mint-token --client-id <id> --role writer --ttl 24h -c config.json`; the same token
authenticates the bridge. Give it at least the `writer` [tier](configuration.md#authorisation) — the
bridge's tools include `store_memory` and `create_event` — or `reader` if you only expose the
read-only tools. Add `--group <label>` to that mint command to scope the model to one slice of a
shared store. The token may also be supplied as `HIPPOCAMPUS_MCP_TOKEN` (any flag maps to
`HIPPOCAMPUS_MCP_<NAME>` with dashes as underscores), keeping the secret out of the argv the host
stores.

### Flags

| Flag                           | Default           | Purpose                                           |

| `--version`                    | —                 | Print the version and exit.                       |

## Host configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add an entry to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hippocampus": {
      "command": "/path/to/hippocampus-mcp",
      "args": ["--address", "localhost:50051"],
      "env": {
        "HIPPOCAMPUS_MCP_TOKEN": "your-token-if-auth-is-enabled"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

```sh
claude mcp add hippocampus -- /path/to/hippocampus-mcp --address localhost:50051
```

`claude mcp add` registers the server in **local** scope (this project only) by default. Add
`--scope user` to make it available in every project, or `--scope project` to write it to the repo's
`.mcp.json` for a team. If the service listens on a non-default gRPC port — for instance when another
instance already owns `50051` — point `--address` at it (e.g. `--address localhost:50151`). A newly
added server is picked up when the host starts a session, so restart Claude Code after adding it.

## Running with Docker

The bridge fits the **embedded** deployment naturally — one instance, one store, one mind — and there
are two ways to run it against a containerised Hippocampus.

### stdio, against a containerised service (the common local case)

Every compose file publishes the gRPC port (`50051`), so the stdio bridge — spawned by your MCP host
on the host machine — dials it exactly as it would a local process. Nothing extra runs in Docker:

```sh
docker compose up --build                       # Hippocampus in a container, :50051 published
go build -C integrations/mcp -o "$PWD/hippocampus-mcp" .
claude mcp add hippocampus -- ./hippocampus-mcp --address localhost:50051
```

The host launches the local binary over stdin/stdout; it reaches into the container over `:50051`.

### HTTP, as a compose service (a shared endpoint)

For a network-reachable MCP endpoint (a remote/hosted host, or several hosts sharing one), the SQLite
compose file carries an opt-in `mcp` service on the streamable-HTTP transport, behind a compose
profile so the default `up` is unchanged:

```sh
docker compose --profile mcp up --build
```

It builds the `mcp` image target (`Dockerfile`), dials the `hippocampus` service over the compose
network, and publishes the MCP endpoint on the host's **loopback** only (`127.0.0.1:8090`). Point an
HTTP-capable MCP host at `http://localhost:8090`. Set `MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` in the environment of
`docker compose up` to require it of every request. Unset, the endpoint is **unauthenticated**,
like the rest of that stack. Inside the container the bridge has to bind every interface to be
reachable, so the service passes `--allow-unauthenticated-http`, and the loopback publish is what
keeps it local. Put it behind TLS (or a proxy that terminates it) before exposing it beyond
localhost.

## Notes

- The MCP host may dispatch tool calls concurrently. A `store_memory` immediately followed by a
  `list_memories` can therefore race — the store commits, but the list may run first and not see it.
  This is host batching behaviour, not a consistency gap in the store; a subsequent list reflects
  the write.
- `search_memories` needs the service to have a content-search backend. Every storage driver has
  one built in, so nothing else is required for keyword search; where none is available the tool
  returns a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error, surfaced to the model as a tool error. `semantic`/`hybrid`
  modes need OpenSearch plus an embedding model, on every driver — `whoami` reports which modes a
  deployment serves, so a model can ask rather than find out by being refused.
- The listing tools take their time bounds as RFC3339 timestamps (`stored_after`,
  `started_before`, …) while the memories they return carry UnixNano `time_stamp` fields, which is
  the service's own representation. The asymmetry is deliberate: a model can write a date but
  cannot reliably arrive at a nanosecond epoch, and a bound wrong by three orders of magnitude
  returns a plausible-looking empty page rather than an error.
